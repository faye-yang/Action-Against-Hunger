## Action Against Hunger Team Project
### Description

We are building an social platform supports both web and android for all members in Action Against Hunger community to share knowledge, perform activities.
- It is not a new project. The previous team developed an android app with basic functions like
login, view/edit posts etc. However from our partner’s feedback, They did not use the app because the user’s signup function does not meet their security requirements. Another reason prevent them from using is the posting experiences. As we can imagine, making a long posting on phone is such painful, let alone a good layout. Based on this, we come up with a idea to create a web version for it.  The web version could be accessed from computers, which makes long typing pretty easy with a real keyboard. In addition, It can improve the efficiency for admin to manage all the users, posts and stuff on a  big screen with the help of mouse and keyboard rather than typing on phone. Besides, by applying responsive design, our product could provide fairly good user experiences for all devices.
- For security reasons, it suppose to be a closed community, which means no unverified people
could get in. We will not have sign up option on the webpage,  but a login entrance. Every account should be created by administration. Besides, for anonymous purpose for students, we also provide some “one step” method for teacher to create a pool of accounts without students’ personal information.
- For facilitating more communications between different schools at different locations,
instead of just having a one-way post, we would like to add more interactive features to it, for example like or dislike some posts, add it to favourite, notification for comment etc.  We also have Q&A section where students could ask questions, teachers and professionals could make answers.
- To increase student interest and retention, we have a feature called activity. Teachers could
create an activity and invite all students or other schools to participate. For example, when the activity is about growing some plant in their own school, students from different schools could post regular pictures to track progress and make discussions.

### Target user:
